                I am a fast and avid learner who is liked by his teammates. Coming from a defence 
                background, discipline is deep rooted in my work ethics. I am passionate about 
                developing solutions that cater to the real world problems with quick and innovative ideas.

                At 16, I co-founded <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Juvenile Foundation</span>, 
                where I gained skills such as Leadership, Graphic Design, SEO, project management and 
                understanding the formal industrial work culture.

                What I find unique about me is that I understand where to apply emotional intelligence 
                and where to be practical. Learning from mistakes rather than regretting or frustrating 
                about it also makes me calm and reliable to work with.
